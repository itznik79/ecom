make the directory eg :monorepo
navigate to it

use script to create the basic folder or create them manually also have to create package-json, below is the example of repo structure
react-nest-monorepo/
├─ apps/     ===================  Deployable applications (API, Web)
├─ packages/  ==================   Shared code (types, configs, utils)
├─ infra/    ====================== DB, Docker, CI, migrations, env
├─ package.json  
├─ docker-compose.yml
├─ tsconfig.base.json

once we are done with this, navigate to apps/
then, run the command : npx @nestjs/cli new api --package-manager npm (to get the basic setup of nest)
